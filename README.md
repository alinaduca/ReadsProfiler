# ReadsProfiler ðŸ“š

This project represents a client-server application in C++ that provides access to an online library. The books can be searched according to various criteria (genre, author, title, year of publication, ISBN, rating) and downloaded by the customer. The server keeps records of the searches and results accessed by a client for a certain search, as well as the downloads made by him, and based on all this information he will be able to offer book recommendations to the client.
